# XSL for FatturaPA in South-Tyrol
This repository contains a new XSL Stylesheet for the Italian e-invoice (http://fatturapa.gov.it). It is specifically meant to be used in South Tyrol since it generates a bilingual (German + Italian) rendering of a given XML invoice with an enhanced layout with respect to the original stylesheet (http://www.fatturapa.gov.it/export/fatturazione/sdi/fatturapa/v1.1/fatturapa_v1.1.xsl).
